## ðŸ”¨ What did I add

### Components added by me

- <b>JupiterIndicator.tsx</b> (src/components/JupiterIndicator/JupiterIndicator.tsx)
- <b>JupiterIndicator.css</b> (src/components/JupiterIndicator/JupiterIndicator.css)
- <b>OpenNewPosition.tsx</b> (src/components/OpenNewPosition/OpenNewPosition.tsx)

### Adding axios

- I have decided to use axios for HTTP requests

```bash
npm install axios
```

<h2>Short description (please read about the 3-5 seconds delay)</h2>
<p>The application is fully functional (as expected in the PDF with the tasks). When a pool is indexed by Jupiter, it is indicated by a glowing Jupiter icon. If a pool is not indexed by Jupiter, the icon remains unlit.</p>
<h3>However, when changing or selecting the specific market, the app needs around 3-5 seconds to change the icon to glowing or vice versa.</h3>
<b>So please be patient and wait 3-5 seconds for the program to search the indexes and change the icon.<b>

<p>Thanks for the task, Filip BereszyÅ„ski</p>
