## ðŸ”¨ What did I add

### Components added by me

- JupiterIndicator.tsx (src/components/JupiterIndicator/JupiterIndicator.tsx)
- JupiterIndicator.css (src/components/JupiterIndicator/JupiterIndicator.css)
- OpenNewPosition.tsx (src/components/OpenNewPosition/OpenNewPosition.tsx)

### Adding axios

- I have decided to use axios for HTTP requests

```bash
npm install axios
```

<h2>Short description <span style="color:yellow">(please read about the 3-5 seconds delay)</span></h2>
<p>The application is fully functional (as expected in the PDF with the tasks). When a pool is indexed by Jupiter, it is indicated by a glowing Jupiter icon. If a pool is not indexed by Jupiter, the icon remains unlit.</p>
<h3>However, when changing or selecting for the first time specific market, the app needs 3-5 seconds to change to icon to glowing or vice versa.</h3>
<b>So please be patient and wait 3-5 seconds for the program to search the indexes and change the icon<b>
